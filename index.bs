Introduction
=======================================================

The [NDE-Usable](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/bruikbaar/) programme of the [Dutch Digital Heritage Network (NDE)](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/) aims at redesigning the infrastructure with which cultural institutions and applications (eg. service portals that allow users to search for specific heritage data) exchange data.
This is to replace the current cascade of tightly coupled data aggregators where integrations are brittle. 
Due to the inflexibility, there are high maintenance costs on the side of the data providing institution and the side of the aggregator. 
Moreover, it leads to data duplication and a loss of control for the cultural heritage institutions.
NDE-Usable envisions a discovery infrastructure that navigates applications to the relevant original data sources, rather than aggregate and republish their data.
The design integrates applications with institutions's collection data in a more loose-couple manner, enabling institutions to reorientate their data more easiliy to other services. 
To this end, NDE-Usable provides implementation guidelines, interoperability requirements and essential discovery services, ie. a register for dataset descriptions and a search index for shared terminology sources (Network of Terms).

The network design of NDE-Usable resonate heavily with the principles of Decentralized Web and Solid.
Hence, this ErfgoedPod project constructs the necessary building blocks for implementing the NDE-Usable design using the Solid protocol, thus establishing a Decentralized Digital heritage network.
In essence, the project tests whether the principles of a decentralized social network - actors announcing, sharing & following their own information - are a good basis for implementing a sustainable digital heritage network.
The main project outcomes are protocols and components for creating generic decentralized artefact exchange networks, which is joint work with the [ResearcherPod](https://mellonscholarlycommunication.github.io/spec-overview) project.
Additionally, ErfgoedPod provides a small background study, an architectural design and a descriptions of relevant use cases to apply these generic protocols and components in the digital heritage domain.

This document captures the use cases that originate from the NDE-Usable programme.
To that end, it identifies a list of representative business processes that the different roles and services in the Dutch Digital Heritage Network should be able to execute.
These business processes serve as a basis for a proof-of-concept implementation of  decentralized artefact exchange network in the digital heritage domain.  

# Context Dutch Digital Heritage Network

The diagram below updates the [high level design](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/high-level-design/blob/master/glossary.md) of NDE with the proposed components in the ResearcherPod project in order to provide a consolidated view.
It extends the [original building blocks diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/high-level-design/maste/high-level-design/master/assets/img/building-blocks.svgr/assets/img/building-blocks.svg) to resemble a decentralized implementation according to the ResearcherPod design.

</pre>

The remainder of this section provides more detail on how the current cultural heritage landscape would populate such high-level design.
In the tables below, we aim to establish a shared understanding the different [[#actors]] (who is participating?), [[#roles]] (what is their function?), and [[#artefacts]] (what are they exchanging?) throughout this project and related initiatives.
The terminology originates from the [high level design](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/high-level-design/blob/master/glossary.md) and the [datasets requirements](https://netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed.github.io/requirements-datasets) 
and is aligned with the dutch architecture standard [\DERA](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/activiteiten/dera/) and the flemish vocabulary standard [\OSLO](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns#Vocabularia), .

## Actors in the network ## {#actors}

The Digital Heritage Network (NDE) brings together a large number of active parties in one interoperable network.
In [[architecture-nde|Decentralized Digital Heritage Network architecture]], these parties are defined as [[architecture-nde#actor|Actors]].
An [[architecture-nde#actor|actor]] represents a human or organisational stakeholder that needs to interact with the digital heritage data in the network.
The list of possible actor types is given below. 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Term</th>
      <th>Description</th>

## Artefacts in the network ## {#artefacts}

Actors can exchange a couple of data objects on the Digital Heritage Network, which are denoted by the [[architecture-nde|Decentralized Digital Heritage Network architecture]] as artefacts.
An [[architecture-nde#artefact|Artefact]] is the smallest unit that is being exchanged; it is the object of an interaction between actors
The list of relevant digital heritage artefacts is given below.

## Basic setup for Decentralized Digital Heritage Network

The ErfgoedPod project provides a number of components described in the [[architecture-nde#components]].
These components can be applied to the NDE context, 
positioning the [[#artefacts]] and [[#roles]] (taken on by [[#actors]]) in a decentralized Digital Heritage Network setup.
All metadata providers, which includes the [=Cultural Heritage Institutions=] and [=Term Source maintainers=]),
deploy a [[architecture-nde#digital-heritage-pod]] their exchange hub for artefact data.

The three main roles [=Registry=], [=Network of Terms=], and [=Knowledge Graph=] each serve as a [[architecture-nde#service-hub|Service Hub]].
Each role can have multiple instances, possibly partitioned based on region or domain, creating a selection of Service Hubs to interact with.
Unlike the metadata providers, it is up to the instance how the service is implemented.
However, if a service hub would provide data to other actors, it has to adopt a [[architecture-nde#digital-heritage-pod|Digital Heritage Pod]].

All Digital Heritage Pod and Digital Heritage Service Hub are enhanced with the remaining components: 
- an [=Inbox=] resource to receive [[ldn|Linked Data Notifications]] ([[architecture-nde#pod]]);
- a `Dashboard` and an `Orchestrator` with `Rulebook` to participate in the network ([[architecture-nde#participate]])
- a `Query index` and a [[architecture-nde#artefact-lifecycle-event-log|Artefact Lifecycle Event Log]] to allow their infomation to be collected by others ([[architecture-nde#collection-information-from-a-decentralized-digital-heritage-network]])

The complete setup can be summarized in a component blueprint, which can be used to implement any component in the Decentralized Digital Heritage Network.
An overview is illustrated in the figure below.

Pilot Use Cases {#usecases}
=======================================================

This section documents a selection of use cases from three Dutch Digital Heritage Network members: [Van Gogh Worldwide](https://vangoghworldwide.org), [Brabants Erfgoed](https://www.brabantserfgoed.nl) and [Oorlogsbronnen](https://www.brabantserfgoed.nl).
They help constructing a reference set of business processes that are common in a network of digital heritage stakeholders.
The result is described in [[#businessprocesses]].

Because ErfgoedPod project attempts at making digital heritage more usable, the selected use cases deliberately take the perspective of the end-user applications or [=Service Portal=].
Therefore, the [=Service Portal Providers=] were consulted with the following three questions:

1. How do they discover datasets?
2. How do they decide which of these datasets are relevant for their portal?
3. How can the Dutch Digital Heritage Network design, in particular the [=Registry=], [=Knowledge Graph=], and [=Network of Terms=] actor roles, help this process?

Issue: check discovery method in table below by Sjors

Business processes {#businessprocesses}
=======================================================

The following scenarios aim at capturing what an architecture based on Decentralized Web should enable for users. In this context, the users are the different stakeholders that are active in the network:

1. the Cultural Heritage Institutions, who provide datasets, and Term Source Providers. A single organization can be both, but not always;
2. organizations that take up the Registry Function;
3. organizations that act as a Network of Terms.
4. organizations that act as a Knowledge Graph.

Scenarios are noted in the following template:

: Roles     
:: The different [[#roles]] that interact with the process.
: Components
:: The [[architecture-nde#components|architectural components]] that are involved.
: Goal             
:: The final successful outcome that completes the process.
: Stakeholders     
:: Anybody or anything with an interest or investment in how the system performs.
: Preconditions    
:: The elements that must be true before a use case can occur.
: Triggers         
:: The events that cause the use case to begin.
: Postconditions   
:: What the system should have completed by the end of the steps.
: Procedure        
:: The process and steps taken to reach the end goal, including the necessary functional requirements and their anticipated behaviors.

Issue: TODO: split of conceptual BP and implementation

This section takes an internal perspective on the [=Cultural Heritage Institution=].
This includes business processes that only affect actors inside a single institution and are often of preparational or operational nature such as setting up a software component.

## Perspective Cultural Heritage Institution - Registry

This section takes the perspective of an [=Cultural Heritage Institution=] interacting with a [=Registry=] Service, which implements the design of the [Registry-function](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-E4DIwlzbL8Esv5YtHbVUXkT_U3pCprFDSI-hjiKf90/edit?ts=5fbd2dcd#) using the Solid and ResearcherPod architecture.
This entails business processes that are shared between both parties where the institution is requesting a service (ie. adding, updating or removing dataset summaries from the registry) and the [=Registry=] responding to that request.
The latter includes the possible outcome of the performed service.
